# Notion connector

This is a suite of notion plugins that I built for myself, and anyone else wanting to use them.

- Notion TMDB: syncs a notion DB with TMDB to help build movie watchlists
- Notion GBook: syncs a notion DB with GBook to help build book readlists

My dev roadmap is on [Notion](https://michelsalib.notion.site/ca1917bcf6174025a8533ed51450a073?v=101bb1cb1e0980c8870b000c95acaf85).

Hosted and free to use on https://notion-tmdb.micheldev.com.
